# Underwater Zoo Race

![Game logo](uzr_logo.png)

In this underwater multiplayer roguelike, take control of a drowning animal and guide it to the exit!

Your goal is simple - reach the exit before any other player does. But there are a few complications:

- You need oxygen to survive. Pick up air bubbles to fill up your oxygen meter. Every movement step drains your oxygen. If the meter reaches 0, you die ðŸ˜µ
- The exit needs to be opened first by using one of the switches placed on the map
- Enemy players can attack you by walking into you (and you can attack them too). Being hit removes some oxygen from each player's meter.

How to play:

- Open the webpage https://srile.github.io/ggj-2025/ (or you can create a private game by passing a `roomId` parameter to the URL, like [https://srile.github.io/ggj-2025/?roomId=ggj2025private](https://srile.github.io/ggj-2025/?roomId=ggj2025private), then share this URL with your friends!)
- Click 'Play Game'
- Wait for other players to join (or not). Up to 4 players can join one game.
- Start playing
- Be the fastest animal!
- After a player wins the round, a new map is loaded and a new round begins.
- Maps are generated randomly. Every round is a new adventure ðŸ‘½
